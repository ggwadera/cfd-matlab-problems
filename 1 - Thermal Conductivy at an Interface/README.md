# Problem 1

## Thermal Conductivity Evaluation at an Interface

Please read the pdf included in this folder to understand about the implementation and results.

The proposed problem consists of a wall composed by two materials
of different thermal conductivities, with a prescribed heat flow *q*'' = 6000 W/m^2
on the left border, and a convective heat flow on the right border, with *h* = 100 W/(m^2 K) and *T*_∞ = 40 °C. For this case, steady state is assumed.

It is requested to find the temperature profile along the wall using two different methods to evalute the thermal conductivity at the materials interface: thermal resistances, and linear variation. It's also requested to compare the results of both methods against the exact analytical solution.
