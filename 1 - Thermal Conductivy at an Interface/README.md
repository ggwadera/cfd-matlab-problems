The proposed problem consists of a wall composed by two materials
of different thermal conductivities, with a prescribed heat flow <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=q''%20%3D%206000"> W/m^2
on the left border, and a convective heat flow on the right border, with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h%20%3D%20100"> W/(m^2 K) and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T_%5Cinfty%3D40"> Â°C. For this case, steady state is assumed.
