\section{Conclusion}

In this work, a program was implemented to solve a heat conduction problem in the steady state, through discretization by the finite volume method, in which the thermal conductivity at the interface between the two materials was evaluated by the resistance method and by linear variation .
The results showed that for the resistance method, the result obtained is exact, while for the linear variation, it is necessary to refine the mesh much more to obtain a temperature profile close to the real profile.
