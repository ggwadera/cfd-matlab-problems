# cfd-matlab-problems
Code I developed to solve CFD and heat tranfers problems for my Computation Heat Transfer and Fluid Mechanics course in college.

This code was developed and tested only on the Matlab software.
There is no guarantee that it will work on Octave.
If you wish to run this on Octave, you are free to port it on your own desire.
I have made this a very long time ago and cannot provide much help.
